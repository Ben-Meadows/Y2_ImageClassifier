# Python Image Classifier

## Introduction
This project is an image classifier developed in Python. The classifier is designed to categorize images into distinct classes using machine learning techniques. The project emphasizes on evaluating classifier performance metrics and optimizing the choice of parameters for improved accuracy.

## Features
- **Classifier Evaluation:** Implements methods to calculate precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy of classifiers.
- **k-Fold Cross Validation:** Employs k-fold cross validation (with up to 100 folds) to assess the performance of the classifiers using only the training data.
- **Optimization of k in kNN:** Investigates methods to rigorously determine the optimal number of neighbors in the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm.
- **Exploration of Advanced Classification Techniques:** Identifies and discusses superior techniques for image classification beyond kNN.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python [specify version, e.g., 3.7 or later]
- Libraries: [list any libraries or frameworks used, e.g., NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn]
- [Any other prerequisites]

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file of the project.
    ```
    git clone [URL to your repository]
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required libraries.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage
1. Navigate to the source directory.
2. Run the main script. Specify the script name, e.g., `python image_classifier.py`.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your data and parameters.

## Tasks
- **Task 2:** Implement methods to output precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy of classifiers.
- **Task 3:** Perform k-fold cross-validation on training data.
- **Task 4:** Research and document the method for choosing the optimal number of neighbors (k) in kNN.
- **Task 6:** Identify and discuss a more advanced approach for image classification than kNN.
